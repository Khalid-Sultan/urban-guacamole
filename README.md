#### Email Harvester written in python

This is a rough implementation in python for the purpose of email harvesting. It first scrapes possible choices based on the engines it has at the moment before going up to 2 levels deep based on the websites it encounters while traversing. Results may come off slow depending on the internet bandwidth and timeout parameter provided.

It's an interactive script that guides you on filling out necessary parameters needed for running the script.

Features included:
- Input Domain Email Searching
- Engines include Google, Reddit, Bing, Yahoo, Instagram, LinkedIn
- Custom Header or Proxy Support
- Custom Timeout
- File output

#### In order for this script to work as intended, please input a timeout>=2 seconds as most websites block scraping tasks because they go against their terms of services.
